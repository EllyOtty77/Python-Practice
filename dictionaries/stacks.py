# In this example, the application creates a list and a variable to determine the
# maximum stack size. Stacks normally have a specific size range. This is
# admittedly a really small stack, but it serves well for the exampleâ€™s needs.
# Stacks work by pushing a value onto the top of the stack and popping values
# back off the top of the stack. The Push() and Pop() functions perform these
# two tasks. The code adds DisplayStack() to make it easier to see the stack
# content as needed.
# The remaining code exercises the stack (demonstrates its functionality) by
# pushing values onto it and then removing them. Four main exercise sections
# test stack functionality
